# Android Recovery

An Android Cordova plugin to enable smooth recovery after Andoird kills the app.

The idea is to have a way to save data that can be recovered after the cordova activity is killed. However, if the user intentionally closes the app, the data is deleted. This can be used to recover the url the user was on.
